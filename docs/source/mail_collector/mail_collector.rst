===============================

email and Exchange functionality.

WIndows events generated by the mail borg client are colected via a chain
composed of `Winlogbeat

`Logstash <https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash>`_, and `RabbitMQ <https://www.rabbitmq.com/>`_.

:note:

        There is a version restriction for both Winlogbeat and Logstash. We
        only support version 6.5.4 for both products.
